LocknLoad 1.0: A small launcher app ( (c) sweetlilmre 05 November 2006)

Usage:
  LocknLoad [profilename]


LocknLoad is basically a poor man's TULL :). I use this to get into and back out of full wince mode.
Its probably of no use to anyone but me, but its free and comes with source :)s

The supplied .ini file contains 2 sections to handle this: [WinceLaunch] and [GizLaunch]

To use it as is, create a folder on your SD card called "wince".
Copy LocknLoad.exe LocknLoad.ini and eCursor (and its associated files) into this directory and
run LocknLoad from here. This will launch full wince with eCursor and the SIP.
You have to have the SIP set up as per:

The ini file will create a shortcut on the wince desktop back to LocknLoad to run with the 
"GizLaunch" profile as the command line. If executed, this will kill explorer and return you 
to the default Giz menu.
