Please note that the version of OpenJazz this port is based on is still pre-alpha and has
some bugs. So, before reporting a bug please check if this bug also
appears in the desktop version of OpenJazz available at
http://treacle.hewwo.com/jazz/oj/index.html
If the bug doesn't appear there too, you're welcome to blame me ;)
