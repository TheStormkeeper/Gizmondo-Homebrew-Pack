Transport Tycoon Deluxe 0.1

This just goes to show that most people can get Pocket PC apps and games running on the Gizmondo, this literally took me 30 minutes to get up and running with a bit of fiddling here and there.
There is still ALOT of work that needs to be done to it but you can have a basic game, I've yet to fully test it out so any bugs/problems reported are appreciated.
It runs in vertical mode, emulating a typical PocketPC, which is a bit awkward controlling, but you can get used to it.
Load and Save works
Important: You need to replace the data files for the full game ones in order to play!

Things to do
Landscape Mode
Button Mapping
Music support
SFX support
