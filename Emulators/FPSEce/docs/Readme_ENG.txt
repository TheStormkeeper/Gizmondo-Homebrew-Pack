FpseCE is DonationWare. If you like it and want to motivate us to continue our project,
(like a Faster Emu with sound) then please visit our homepage and consider making a
donation to authors. We are doing this otherwise for _free_ and spend a lot of time
on this. As you can see we need to be motivated!

This emulator is distributed in the hope that you may find it useful, but carries no
guarantees or warranties.

--------------------------------
    II. System Requirements
--------------------------------
Any Pocket PC running:
* PocketPC2002
* PocketPC2003(Windows Mobile 2003)
* PocketPC2003SE(Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition)
* PocketPC WM5.0 (Windows Mobile 5.0)
The Dell Axim x50v/x51v is recommended to get best performance.

As much free RAM as you can allocate, the more the better. A minimum of at least 16MB
is recommended.

--------------------------------
   III. Installation & Setup
--------------------------------
Extract the .zip content and copy the FpseCE directory anywhere onto your PocketPC.

Put your Bios (i.e scph1001.bin) in your FpseCE\BIOS directory. (This is necessary to get
emulator to work) FpseCE should support all PSX Bios files with .bin extension. SCPH1001
however is recommened to get the best performance and compatibility.

You may put your Isos in the FpseCE\ISOS directory or anywhere else on your PocketPC. 
FpseCE supports only the following isos formats : 
*.iso (2352 bytes/sectors only)
*.img (from clonecd)
*.bin (CDR Win, etc.)
*.nrg (Nero)
*.Z, *.BZ, *.ZNX (A compressed image generated by the PocketISO tool)

!PLEASE NOTE! If you have compressed your image file with PocketISO (available on our
homepage/forum), be sure to copy both the '.Z'(or '.BZ'/'.ZNX') file and the '.table'/
'.index' file into the same directory on your PocketPC.

If you have any PSX Executables (Demos and/or homebrew) place them into the
FpseCE\EXE directory on your PocketPC.
FpseCE supports the following executable formats:
- PS-X files (*.exe, *.psx)
- COFF files (*.elf)
- CPE files (*.cpe)
As well as the images from above.

Once everything is set and ready, start FpseCE. 
First you will need to setup the BIOS. Go to "Options > Bios > Choose" to select a BIOS
stored previously in FpseCE\BIOS directory.

You can choose your memory cards by selecting "Options > Memcards > Choose > Card x" menu.
FpseCE supports the following memory card formats:
- PsEmu images (*.mcd)
- Bleem! images (*.mcr)
- Raw images (*.raw)
- VGS images (*.vgs,*.mem)
- DexDrive images (*.gme)
- DataDeck images (*.ddf)

Next assign your buttons by selecting "Options > Joypad > Assign buttons"
Keep in mind that the "MENU" button >must< be bound to a button for landscape-mode 
as you can only exit the emulator in the menu. You can also setup the onscreen buttons as
you like and define if a button is normal "push" or "sticky" (once pressed they stay down 
until pressed again) in the bar under the PDA-graphic.
To change the button/action click on a section on the graphics, this will scroll 
through the available buttons that you can bind to this area and the available actions..

FpseCE supports both ARM V4 and ARM V5 architectures.
If you own an XScale based device (like the Asus A620/Dell x50v) or newer, you can gain 
more speed by selecting "Options > Cpu type > ARM V5". If you enable this option but your 
device can't support it, the emulator will surely crash!

You also have to set the driver you want to use under "Options > Misc > GFX driver" as the 
standard is set to "GAPI" which is for normal wm2003/SE devices. Please set it to "LFB" 
if you want to use a speedboost through linear frame buffering (Axim 2700g accelerator) or 
test "GDI" if you have wm5.0. "VGA" is for all devices that support this resolution but 
may be very slow depending on your PPC.


After all of this has been done, you should be ready to start emulation. 

--------------------------------
    IV. Options
--------------------------------
Open up the options menu to change other various settings:

- You can change the BIOS that FpseCE uses. Select 'Choose BIOS", then select the BIOS
  you want to use.
- You can select the region of Playstation to emulate. USA/EUR/JAP
- You can choose the CPU Mode Recompiler/Interpreter. If a game don't work in recompiler
  mode try in interpreter mode. Keep in mind however that interpreter mode is slower.
- You can select the type of the ARM CPU installed into your device.
- You can assign hardware buttons to PSX Pad Buttons. The 'Menu' button MUST be assigned,
  it is used to set/unset some options as well as stopping the emulation. To assign a
  button tap the image of the button you want to assign, followed by pressing the
  hardware key you want it to map to.
- You can also set the onscreen buttons that only function in landscape mode.
- You can change the Memcard you want to use in each respective slot. To do this, select
  "Memcards > Choose" then tap either card 1 or card 2. To set that card browse to the
  memcard you want in that slot.
- You can toggle the display of the FPS counter (frames per second) on the screen.
- You can force MDEC(PSX video format) decoding to black and white to help speed up
  emulation of MDEC movies.
- You can activate a fast boot option which directly loads an image without booting the
  PSX bios.
- You can enable frameskipping. This option skips some GPU functions and can cause
  glitches in game play. Exercise caution when using this as some games will work a lot 
  better while others will become virtually unplayable.
- You can change the Display orientation between portrait and landscape left & right.
  Only "VGA" driver will not work with this for now.
- You can save individual game configurations. You have first to load a game then quit
  it. Once back to the main menu set all of the options you want for this game, and then
  tap "Config > Save" The next time you load this game, the config will be automatically
  loaded.

--------------------------------
     V. Emulation
--------------------------------
Just select "Start > Start ISO" and choose any ISOS previously stored on your Pocket PC. 
If you press CANCEL without selecting any file, the emulator will boot the BIOS,
the memory card manager and CD player.

You can also open any PSX EXE file. 
To do this select "Start > Start EXE" and choose any PSX Exe previously stored on your
Pocket PC.

You can activate options by pressing the previously assigned 'Menu' button while in
landscape mode, otherwise in portrait mode the options are already on screen.
With the options you can...
- Exit current emulation by tapping the button 'OPTIONS' this will return you to the
  main menu.
- Press any joypad button, useful for pressing any buttons not currently assigned.
- Switch between analog and digital mode by pressing the Digital/Analog button.
- Turn the sound output off and on. You can do it by pressing the 'SOUND' button.
- Turn the FPS counter on and off. The FPS counter, while more accurate in this version,
  does consume extra CPU cycles. To keep emulation speed as fast as possible leave this
  option off while playing.
- Rotate the screen between portrait and landscape modes. Press the looping arrow
  buttons to change this.
- If in landscape mode, press the menu button again to return to the game.
- Resize/move the graphic window in portrait mode. To do this, press the 'Menu' button
  while in portrait mode. then with your stylus you can drag the edge of the rendered
  image to resize it, or drag in the center of it move it. Press the 'Menu' button
  again once you are finished.
- Capture the LCD content by pressing the camera button. This action will generate a
  screenshot into the FpseCE directory.
