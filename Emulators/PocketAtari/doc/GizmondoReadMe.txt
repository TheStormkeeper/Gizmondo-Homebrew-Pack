PocketAtari (open source Atari 800 emulator) 4 Gizmondo.

The WinCE port was originally done by Vasyl Tsvirkunov. http://pocketatari.retrogames.com/

Kostas Nakos joined the development team from version 2.0.0 onwards and is responsible for the WinCE port. http://users.uoa.gr/~knakos/atari800/

TheReaperUK now has ported the WinCE port to the Gizmondo.

Gizmondo Release history:

Almost perfect port of the brillant winCE version.

Keys changed for the Gizmondo, plus added extra keys to help make more games playable.

Some minor code changes.

No onscreen keyboard, left it out as the gizmondo has no touchscreen.
