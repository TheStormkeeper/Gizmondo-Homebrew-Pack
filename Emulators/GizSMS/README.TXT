Usage
-----

ROMs must be in a directory called:

GizSMS

in the root of your SD Card.

GameGear games must have the extension '.gg'.  Master System games must have the extension '.sms'

Buttons
-------

The joypad does what you'd expect.  The other buttons are:

[]	START
|>	B

During emulation, the home key toggles main menu on and off, which will also
pause/resume the emulator.  

Whilst in the main menu, the [] key exits back to the Gizmondo system.

Up and Down on the joypad in the main menu select the ROM, |> starts
