0.09.5 -> 0.09.6

* Changed virtual memory allocation method.
* Fixed a bug into screenshot function.
* Added support for Nero Burning Rom image file (*.NRG)
* Removed XA skip function, it caused bugs and slowdowns.
* Added VGA and linear frame buffer support.
* Several fixes for a clean/smaller code in the GUI.
* Added support for GDI graphic driver.
* Threaded execution and completely rewritten the WinCE code.
* Touch pad emulation is now configurable (STICKY or PUSH mode).
* Sound volume level is saved at the end of an emulation session.
* Onscreen buttons feature the directional keys.

0.09.4 -> 0.09.5

* Fixed lot of "bugs" that caused memory allocation errors on WM2003 SE.
* Fixed compatibility with UNICODE devices.
* Fixed some display bugs into the virtual gamepad.
* Fixed a bug in movies decoding when B/W output is selected.
* Fixed a bug with sound cache buffers.
* Now FPSE is compiled only with Microsoft Libraries except few speed
  critical functions.
* There is just one executable for all CPU and all WinCE platforms (I hope).
  Select your ARM version into the main menu:
	Options->Cpu type->ARM V4    (or ARM V5)
  FPSE has been tested with WM2003 and WM2003SE. I don't know what it will
  happen with WM2002 and older: try it, perhaps it will work.
* Started support for LFB feature on VGA models (not working yet).
* Removed the old file selector. The new rountine is faster, it virtually
  doesn't use memory (the previous one used more than 1MB or ram!!!) and
  it's much more colorful ^_^.
  It's also coded for being resolution-independent, so it should run fine
  in VGA mode too in the future.
* The libraries LibZ and LIBBZip2 are now compiled as DLL.
  This will be an advantage because:
  - It uses less memory.
  - We can change them easily without recompiling the emulator, if one day
    a newer version of those libraries will come out.
* A new automatic frameskip function has been implemented.
  You can see frame skip as a function for running FPSE at least to an 
  FPS value. Here you are what these levels do:

  Level 0: no frames skipped.
  Level 1: try to run the emu at least to 10 fps.
  Level 2: try to run the emu at least to 15 fps.
  Level 3: try to run the emu at least to 20 fps.
  Level 4: try to run the emu at least to 25 fps.
  Level 5: try to run the emu at least to 30 fps.
  Level 6: try to run the emu at least to 35 fps.
  Level 7: try to run the emu at least to 40 fps.
  Level 8: try to run the emu at least to 45 fps.
  Level 9: try to run the emu at least to 50 fps.

  Example: your game runs to 17 fps without frameskip.
  Level 1 and level 2 don't change the speed.
  If you select Level 3, the emulator will skip some frames and it will
  try to run the game at least to 20 fps.
  If you select higher levels, it will skip more frames for getting at 
  least the requested speed. Of course, if the emu skips more, the game
  will be more more unplayable because an "slideshow" effect.
  If during the game there are some points where fps value overcome the
  minimum value of requested level, then no frames are skipped.
  Again, let's suppose that you are at level 2 and you have improved the
  speed from 17 fps to 20 fps.
  If there are some point where the game overcome the 20 fps, then no frame
  skips are done for those points.
* Some small speed improvements with compiled memory functions.
* Sound playback is much smoother now.

0.09.3 -> 0.09.4

* Many, Many bug fix done by LDChen, now emu is extremely stable
* A significant boost done by some optimisations 
* GPU color palette bug fixed
* A new hidden option to make game like MGS running, but Sound emulation
  is broken and should be set to off when you active this option 
  (SpuIRQ=on in FPSE section of FPSE.INI) (Notice, we plan to release soon
  FpseCE 0.09.5 on which we will work on memory block allocation error 
  which occur on some PocketPC WM2003 (If current version don't work for
  you, take a look on syslog.txt, and try none compressed ISO... until 
  next version....) 

0.09.2 -> 0.09.3

* Switched to GCC because it generates faster and smaller code than
  Microsoft C compiler or Intel High performance (bleah!) compiler.
* Many optimisation in code
* Sound is implemented, it's not 100% but work well in most of case 
* GPU texture windows, GFX are lot better now
* Guncon support, emulated by your stylus!
* 3 Frameskip level with 2 frameskip mode is available 
* Change disc support for Multiple dics games

0.09.1 -> 0.09.2

* Compatible with IPAQ 38xx
* GPU texture fix (MGS and others game)
* Some Dynamic Recompiler CPU instruction FIX and Speedup
* ZNX support
* Added support for missing memory card formats

0.09 -> 0.09.1

* Improved the compilation of some MIPS opcodes. This should give you a
  little more speed. (LDChen)
* Fixed a bug in shifting opcodes. Now several games (WipeOut 3, FIFA soccer
  games and others) are fully playable. (LDChen).
* Completely rewritten the blitting routines for displaying graphics.
  Stretching, landscape left/right and portrait modes are implemented. (LDChen)
* Improved movies playback speed. A new, faster IDCT routine optimized
  for ARM is used and some optimizations had been added to YUV to RGB 
  conversions. (LDChen).
* Fixed some GTE bugs. (LDChen)
* Fixed some bugs in rootcounter emulation. Now more games are playable.
  I tested "Ridge Racer revolution", but I think there are others. (LDChen)
* Fixed some bugs in GPU dma command. (LDChen)
* Implemented a basic frame-skipping algorithm. Note: while playing movies,
  frames are not skipped, only during 3D graphic processing. (LDChen)
* Added support for some missing memory card formats available in the main
  FPSE core, but not implemented in the previous FPSEce version (SchTruck)
* Added Frameskip support. (Schtruck)
* Added Landscape left, right and Portrait mode support. (Schtruck)
* Added Better Gapi support, should work for all PocketPC ARM based now.
  (Schtruck)
* Minor Fixes in GUI and system check for better compatibility. (Schtruck)
* Added config save support. (Schtruck)
* Added onscreen button mapping support and configuration. (Schtruck)
* Improved FPS counter, it's OK now... (Schtruck)

0.09
