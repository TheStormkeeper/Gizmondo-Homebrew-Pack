INTRODUCTION
------------

ProSystem is one of the best Atari 7800 emulators for 
Windows.

ProSystem was written by Greg Stanton.
(see http://home.comcast.net/~gscottstanton/) 

ZX81 did a port to the PSP and the GP2X.
(http://zx81.zx81.free.fr/serendipity/)

This is foft's quick/dirty port to Gizmondo.

CONTROL
------------

In the ATARI emulator window 

Only one keyboard mapping, but this can still be 
redefined. Since the Gizmondo has more buttons than 
the 7800 though this is unlikely to need doing... 
Also no onscreen keyboard for similar reasons (it was
SDL and more effort to replace + not much use for 
7800 imho...)

Giz           Atari 7800               

Stop/Rewind   Fire 1
Play/Fforward Fire 2
Left trigger  Left difficulty (rare, some cheats...)
Right trigger Right difficulty (similarly)
Home          Go to menu
Vol+Up/Down   Adjust volume
Asterisk      Pause
Triangle      Select
Power         Reset

In the menus

Fforward      Go forward or select
Rewind        Go backward or select
Play          Select
Stop          Cancel (+ some confirmation dialogs)
Home          Exit menu/sub menu
Power         Reset emu/delete files

LOADING ROM FILES (A78)
------------

Put them in the roms folder under the emulator 
directory. They can either be .a78 files or .zip 
files containing one .78 file.

Then, while inside the emulator, press HOME to 
go to the main menu. From there choose "Load ROM" 
and select the cartridge from the file selector. 
Press HOME to return to the emulator to play.

Most games run fast enough - frameskip is 
automatic, but only tends to be used on heavier 
games. Unfortunately some are still too slow (E.g. 
Mario Brothers). I do not plan to optimise ProSystem, 
but if someone comes up with a better way of 
displaying palette 8-bit screens on the Gizmondo
I'll fix that at least.

Source is GPL. I'll put it on my website 
(www.scrameta.net).
My port is a mess, so don't base other ports on this!

Thanks,

foft
