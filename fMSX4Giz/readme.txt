another quick port by XChip


you need the following roms: msx2p.rom and msx2pext.rom you can get them here: http://fms.komkon.org/fMSX/
you also need the rom of the game: look at the fMSX_CE.cfg and set the CARTANAME variable to point at your rom file, it is pointing by default to kunfu.rom
The emulator has a menu, if you need to access it you can do it using Activesync Remote Display and your cmputer mouse



Long life MSX!
