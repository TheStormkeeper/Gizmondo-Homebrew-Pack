GizNester 0.3.1
---------------

Gizmondo port by critical of PocketNester 0.7, which in turn is based on nester.

It emulates a Nintendo Entertainment System console, complete with sound.

PocketNester is licensed under GNU Generic Public License(GPL), as is GizNester.

The original licence files and documentation may be found in the doc directory of 
the zip file that this readme file came in.

Version 0.3.1 adds L trigger and R trigger paging by 10 ROMS, and a menu makeover
for no good reason.

Installation
------------

Put GizNester.exe in the root of your SD card, along with the included gx.dll 
if you don't already have it.  If you're using firefly's launcher, put everything in
a directory called GizNester in the root of your SD card.


Usage
-----

Multiple NES ROMs are now supported.  They must be in a directory called:

GizNester

in the root of your SD Card.


Buttons
-------

The joypad does what you'd expect.  The other buttons are:

<<	SELECT
[]	START
|>	B
>>	A

During emulation, the home key toggles main menu on and off, which will also 
pause/resume the emulator.

As of version 0.3.0, load/save state has been implemented.
Press the Speaker key to load state, and the Triangle key to save state.
If there is no state to load, and you try to load state, it will say that
it succeeded, but obviously it won't have.

Whilst in the main menu, the STOP key exits back to the Gizmondo system.

Up and Down on the joypad in the main menu select the ROM, PLAY starts
